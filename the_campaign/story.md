You have been sent to the town of Gobbendale to investigate disappearing people.

About once a week a new person seems to go missing from Gobbendale.

A long time ago, Capri Thogu lost #sommething important because the people of Gobbendale did something to it.
Capri Thogu is taking the people away and dropping them into his cave in the mountains. He visit's once a day to give them enough food.
