Every player has a level 2 in everything except where traits affect this.
Every level above 2 gains you a dice in the chosen skill.

If it would be easy for an average person to do, do not bother rolling unless the character has negative traits against a task.

You may buy a trait many times, but the each purchase costs more: Specifically: the nth purchase costs ```n * cost```

For every trait a player has that helps, gain 1 dice unless the card specifies otherwise.
For every negative trait, lose 1 dice.

Dice are all d6:
for each dice roll.
rolls are :
    1: fail -1
    2,3: Nothing 0 
    4,5: Success 1
    6: Double Success 2

Negative score is Crit fail.
Score above passnum is success.
else normal fail.

A wealthy person may ignore purchases up to £100
A Very wealthy person may ignore purchases up to £1000
