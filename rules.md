## Key Terms

* Modifier : How much better/worse are you at something than the average person.

## Core principles

The average person gets 2 dice at every task, this is measured off against the difficulty of the task.
Every level above 2 gains you a dice in the chosen skill.

If it would be easy for an average person to do, don't bother rolling unless the character has negative traits against a task.

For every trait a player has that helps, gain 1 dice unless the card specifies otherwise.
For every negative trait, lose 1 dice.

Dice are all d6:
for each dice roll.

Rolls are :

* 1:        fail -1
* 2:        Nothing 0 
* 3,4,5:    Success 1
* 6:        Double Success 2

Add together the total points.
Less than the required result is a failure.
zero will harml you in some way.
Negative score is Crit fail. This could go very bad.
Score above passnum is success.


Money is handled in pounds £. Items Every level of wealth allows you to ignore one more 0 in the cost of purchases.

A wealthy person may ignore purchases up to £100
A Very wealthy person may ignore purchases up to £1000

## Combat
The combat clock is core to the workings of time and initiative in battle. Faster actions, require you to move less distance on the time clock.

At the beginning of combat each player rolls initiative. The player with the most successes places their marker on the clock first

Resolving an Attack: 
"Attacker rolls Accuracy against Defenders Evade.
    Attacker rolls "Attack + a dice for each leftover accuracy" against Defenders Defense. 
    1 damage per level above.
    If the attackers rolls a crit fail on either point. The attacker takes 1 damage."
